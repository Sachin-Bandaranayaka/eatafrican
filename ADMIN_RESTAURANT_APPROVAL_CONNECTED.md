# âœ… Admin Restaurant Approval - Now Connected!

## What Was Done

### 1. Connected Restaurant Management to Real Database
- Created `RestaurantManagementController-connected.tsx`
- Fetches real restaurants from `/api/admin/restaurants`
- Replaces mock data with live data from Supabase

### 2. Added Approve/Reject Functionality
- Created `AllRestaurantsView-connected.tsx`
- Added APPROVE and REJECT buttons for pending restaurants
- Buttons only show when viewing "NEW REGISTRATION" status

### 3. Updated Main Component
- Modified `components/superAdmin/restaurant/index.tsx`
- Now uses the connected version by default

## How It Works Now

### Step 1: Login as Super Admin
- Email: `admin@eatafrican.ch`
- Password: `password123`

### Step 2: Navigate to Restaurant Section
- Click "RESTAURANT" tab in admin portal
- You'll see "RESTAURANT MANAGEMENT" by default

### Step 3: View Pending Registrations
- Click the "NEW REGISTRATION" dropdown (top right)
- You'll see all pending restaurants including:
  - **sachin's restaurant** (your submission!)

### Step 4: Approve or Reject
- Click **APPROVE** button â†’ Restaurant status changes to 'active'
- Click **REJECT** button â†’ Restaurant status changes to 'suspended'

## What You'll See

### NEW REGISTRATION Tab
```
ALL REGIONS | RESTAURANT NAME      | ADDRESS        | REGISTRATION DATE | ACTIONS

TEST
            sachin's restaurant   test, test      09.10.2025         [APPROVE] [REJECT]
```

### After Approval
- Restaurant disappears from "NEW REGISTRATION"
- Appears in "ACTIVE" tab
- Becomes visible on customer website
- Owner can start adding menu items
