**Status Flow:**
```
new → confirmed → preparing → ready_for_pickup → assigned → in_transit → delivered
  ↓       ↓          ↓              ↓              ↓           ↓
  cancelled (from any non-terminal state)
```

### 6.4 Create Customer Orders Endpoint (GET /api/customers/[id]/orders)
**File:** `app/api/customers/[id]/orders/route.ts`

## Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication & Authorization
- Uses existing middleware from `lib/middleware/auth.ts`
- Implements role-based access control
- Supports optional authentication for guest orders
- Validates ownership and permissions at multiple levels

### Data Validation
- Uses Zod schemas from `lib/validation/schemas.ts`
- Validates all request bodies and query parameters
- Provides detailed error messages

### Database Operations
- Uses Supabase client from `lib/supabase/database.ts`
- Implements proper error handling
- Uses transactions where needed (order + order items creation)
- Efficient queries with proper joins and filters

### Business Logic
- Distance calculation using Haversine formula
- Delivery fee calculation (base fee + per km charge)
- Tax calculation (8.1% Swiss VAT)
- Voucher discount application (percentage and fixed)
- Loyalty points calculation (1 point per CHF)
- Operating hours validation
- Status transition validation

### Error Handling
- Consistent error response format
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Detailed error messages
- Proper logging for debugging

### Notifications
- Database-stored notifications
- Role-based notification routing
- Status-specific notification messages
- Non-blocking (doesn't fail order operations)

   - Test with authenticated user
   - Test as guest user
   - Test with valid voucher code
   - Test with invalid voucher
   - Test outside delivery radius
   - Test during closed hours
   - Test below minimum order amount

2. **Order Details:**
   - Test as customer (own order)
   - Test as restaurant owner
   - Test as driver
   - Test unauthorized access

3. **Status Updates:**
   - Test valid transitions
   - Test invalid transitions
   - Test driver assignment
   - Test delivery completion
   - Verify notifications are created

4. **Customer Orders:**

## Next Steps

The order processing APIs are complete and ready for integration with:
1. **Driver Management APIs (Task 7)** - For driver order acceptance and management
2. **Payment Gateway Integration (Task 9)** - To update payment status from 'pending'
3. **Frontend Integration** - Connect existing frontend to these endpoints
4. **Testing** - Comprehensive testing with real data

## Files Created

1. `app/api/orders/route.ts` - Order creation endpoint
2. `app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` - Order details endpoint
3. `app/api/orders/[id]/status/route.ts` - Order status update endpoint
4. `app/api/customers/[id]/orders/route.ts` - Customer orders listing endpoint

All files are TypeScript, follow Next.js 15 App Router conventions, and include comprehensive error handling and validation.
