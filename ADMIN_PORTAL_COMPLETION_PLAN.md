## 🎯 Recommended Approach

Given the scope, I recommend building in this order:

### Phase 1: Orders Management (NEXT)
This is the most critical for business operations.

### Phase 2: Driver Management
Second most important for operations.

### Phase 3: Customer Accounts
Important for user management.

### Phase 4: Earnings/Payouts
Can be built last as it's more reporting-focused.

## 💡 What I'll Build Now

I'll start with **Orders Management** - a complete interface to:
1. View all orders in a table
2. Filter by status, date, restaurant
3. View order details in a modal
4. Update order status
5. Search functionality

This will give you full control over order management from the admin portal.
