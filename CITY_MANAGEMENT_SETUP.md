# City Management System - Setup Complete

## Overview
Implemented a complete city management system that allows Super Admins to add, edit, and delete delivery cities through the admin panel. All forms now fetch cities dynamically from the database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database
- **Table**: `cities`
  - `id` (UUID, primary key)
  - `name` (VARCHAR, unique)
  - `display_order` (INTEGER)
  - `is_active` (BOOLEAN)
  - `created_at`, `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP)
- **Initial Data**: Basel, Bern, Luzern, Olten, Zürich
- **RLS Policies**: 
  - Public read access for active cities
  - Super admin only for modifications

### 2. API Endpoints
- `GET /api/cities` - Fetch all active cities (public)
- `POST /api/cities` - Create new city (super admin only)
- `PUT /api/cities/[id]` - Update city (super admin only)
- `DELETE /api/cities/[id]` - Delete city (super admin only)

### 3. Admin UI
- **Location**: Super Admin → Settings → "CITIES MANAGEMENT"
- **Features**:
  - View all cities in a table
  - Edit city name and display order inline
  - Delete cities with confirmation
  - Add new cities with display order
  - Clean, intuitive interface

### 4. Dynamic Forms Updated
All forms now fetch cities from the API:
- ✅ Partner Restaurant Registration (`components/restaurantRegistration/RegistrationForm.tsx`)
- ✅ Driver Registration (`components/driverPortal/auth/register.tsx`)
- ✅ Driver Portal - Orders Section (`components/driverPortal/OrdersSection.tsx`)
- ✅ Driver Portal - Orders Section Connected (`components/driverPortal/OrdersSection-connected.tsx`)

## How to Use

### As Super Admin:
1. Login to Super Admin panel
2. Navigate to **Settings**
3. Select **"CITIES MANAGEMENT"** from dropdown
4. Manage cities:
   - **Edit**: Click pencil icon, modify, click save
   - **Delete**: Click trash icon, confirm deletion
   - **Add**: Click "Add New City" button, enter details, save

### For Developers:
Cities are automatically fetched in all forms. If the API fails, forms have fallback to hardcoded cities.

## Benefits

✅ **Single Source of Truth**: All cities managed in one place
✅ **No Code Changes**: Add/remove cities without deploying code
✅ **Data Consistency**: Restaurant cities always match driver zones
✅ **Better UX**: Users see only active, available cities
✅ **Scalable**: Easy to expand to new cities

## Notes

- API validation schemas (`app/api/drivers/route.ts`, `app/api/drivers/[id]/route.ts`) still use hardcoded enums for type safety
- Consider updating these to dynamic validation if cities change frequently
- All forms have fallback arrays in case API is unavailable
- Display order determines the sort order in dropdowns

## Testing

To test the system:
1. Access Super Admin Settings → Cities Management
2. Add a new city (e.g., "Geneva")
3. Check that it appears in:
   - Partner restaurant registration form
   - Driver registration form
   - Driver portal pickup zone selector
4. Edit or delete the city and verify changes propagate

## Migration Applied
✅ Migration `006_create_cities_table.sql` applied successfully to Supabase
