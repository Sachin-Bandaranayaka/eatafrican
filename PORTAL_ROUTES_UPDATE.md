# Portal Routes Update

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Test Buttons from Header
Cleaned up the site header by removing all test/development buttons:
- ❌ Removed "DASHBOARD testing" button
- ❌ Removed "DRIVER PORTAL login test" button  
- ❌ Removed "Admin login testing" button
- ❌ Removed "Super Admin" button

The header now only shows the production-ready elements:
- Language selector
- Dashboard button
- Login button
- Shopping cart

### 2. Created Separate Routes

#### Super Admin Portal: `/admin`
- New route at `app/admin/page.tsx`
- Shows login screen if not authenticated
- Checks for `super_admin` role
- Redirects to homepage if unauthorized
- Full dashboard with all admin views once logged in

#### Driver Portal: `/driver-portal`
- Already existed at `app/driver-portal/page.tsx`
- Shows login screen if not authenticated
- Checks for `driver` role
- Redirects to homepage if unauthorized

### 3. How to Access

**Super Admin Portal:**
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- Or in production: `https://yourdomain.com/admin`

**Driver Portal:**
- Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/driver-portal`
- Or in production: `https://yourdomain.com/driver-portal`

### 4. Security Features

Both portals include:
- Authentication check on page load
- Role-based access control
- Automatic redirect if unauthorized
- Token validation from localStorage
- Loading states during auth check
