## Requirements Satisfied

All requirements from Requirement 4 (Delivery Driver Operations) have been implemented:

- ✅ 4.7: Inactive drivers cannot accept new orders

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Driver Registration:**
   - Test with valid user ID
   - Test duplicate registration prevention
   - Test with invalid pickup zones

2. **Order Acceptance:**
   - Test with active driver
   - Test with inactive driver
   - Test zone mismatch scenarios
   - Test double-assignment prevention

3. **Order Filtering:**
   - Test available orders filtered by zone
   - Test driver orders filtered by status
   - Test date range filtering
   - Test pagination

4. **Permissions:**
   - Test driver accessing own data
   - Test driver accessing other driver's data
   - Test admin accessing any driver's data

## Next Steps

The driver management system is now complete. The next task in the implementation plan is:
