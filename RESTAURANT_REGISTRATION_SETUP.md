### 3. Enhanced Form Components

## How to Use

### For Restaurant Owners

1. **Visit the Registration Page**
   - Click "PARTNER WITH US" in the footer
   - Or navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/partner-restaurant`

2. **Fill Out the Form**
   - Contact Details (First Name, Last Name, Phone, Email)
   - Restaurant Information (Name, Address, City, Postal Code)
   - Type of Restaurant
   - Delivery Method
   - Country Specialty (Ethiopian, Eritrean, Kenyan, Ghana, Nigeria, or Other)

3. **Submit**

## Form Fields Collected

```typescript
{
  firstName: string,
  lastName: string,
  phone: string,
  email: string,
  restaurantName: string,
  city: string,
  postalCode: string,
  street: string,
  restaurantType: string,
  deliveryMethod: string,
  cuisineTypes: string[],  // Array of selected cuisines
  otherSpecialty: string
}
```

## How It Works Now (Backend Connected!)

### Step 1: User Account Creation
When you submit the form, it first creates a user account:
- Calls `/api/auth/register`
- Creates user with `restaurant_owner` role
- Returns authentication token

### Step 2: Restaurant Creation
Then it creates the restaurant:
- Calls `/api/restaurants` with the auth token
- Creates restaurant with `pending` status
- Waits for admin approval

### Step 3: Success
- Shows success message
- Restaurant owner can now login
- Admin needs to approve the restaurant before it goes live

## What Gets Saved

### User Record
- Email, password (hashed)
- First name, last name
- Phone number
- Role: `restaurant_owner`

### Restaurant Record
- Restaurant name
- Address (street, city, postal code)
- Cuisine types (Ethiopian, Eritrean, Kenyan, etc.)
- Contact info (phone, email)
- Status: `pending` (requires admin approval)
- Default opening hours (11:00-22:00 daily)
- Min order amount: CHF 24.00

## Optional Enhancements

### File Uploads (Not Yet Implemented)
The form has file upload fields but they're not connected yet. To add:
- Use the `/api/uploads` endpoint
- Upload to Supabase Storage
- Get the URLs and include them in the restaurant creation

### Geocoding (Not Yet Implemented)
Currently latitude/longitude are null. To add:
- Use a geocoding service (Google Maps, Mapbox)
- Convert address to coordinates
- Include in restaurant creation

## Testing

1. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

3. Scroll to the footer and click "PARTNER WITH US"

4. Fill out the form and test the submission
