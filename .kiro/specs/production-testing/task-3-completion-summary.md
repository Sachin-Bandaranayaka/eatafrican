```

## Issues Found

None. All functionality worked as expected.

## Recommendations

1. **Distance String Format:** Consider adding "from [location]" to distance strings as mentioned in requirements (e.g., "9 km, 47 min from Olten")

2. **Image Upload Testing:** Perform manual testing with actual image files to verify:
   - File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
   - File size validation (max 5MB)
   - Supabase Storage integration
   - Public URL generation

3. **Email Notifications:** Implement email service integration for restaurant approval notifications

4. **Duplicate Restaurant Check:** The API correctly prevents restaurant owners from creating multiple restaurants (409 Conflict)

5. **Search Optimization:** Consider adding full-text search for better search performance with large datasets

## Data Integrity Verification

All database queries confirmed:
