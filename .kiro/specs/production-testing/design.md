# Design Document

## Overview

This design document outlines a comprehensive testing and validation strategy for the food delivery platform to ensure production readiness. The approach combines automated testing, manual testing, and systematic validation of all features using real data from Supabase. The testing effort will use the Supabase MCP (Model Context Protocol) to interact directly with the database, validate data integrity, and test API endpoints.

### Testing Approach

- **Real Data Testing**: All tests use actual Supabase database, no mocks or stubs
- **MCP Integration**: Leverage Supabase MCP tools for database queries and validation
- **Systematic Coverage**: Test every API endpoint, frontend component, and user flow
- **Role-Based Testing**: Test from perspective of each user role (customer, restaurant owner, driver, admin)
- **End-to-End Validation**: Verify complete user journeys work correctly
- **Performance Monitoring**: Measure response times and identify bottlenecks

### Testing Tools

- **Supabase MCP**: Direct database access and SQL execution
- **Browser DevTools**: Network inspection and frontend debugging
- **Manual Testing**: User interface and experience validation
- **API Testing**: Direct endpoint testing with various scenarios
- **Database Queries**: Validation of data integrity and relationships

## Architecture

### Test Data Strategy

1. **Initial State**: Start with seeded database containing sample data
2. **Test Isolation**: Each test scenario uses unique identifiers
3. **Data Cleanup**: Option to reset database between test runs
4. **Real Scenarios**: Use realistic data matching production use cases

## Components and Interfaces

2. **Performance Acceptable**: API response times under 500ms for 95% of requests
3. **Security Validated**: No critical security vulnerabilities found
4. **Data Integrity Confirmed**: All data consistency checks pass
5. **Frontend Functional**: All components work with real backend data
6. **Documentation Complete**: All deployment and operational docs ready
7. **Monitoring Active**: Error tracking and logging functional
8. **Backups Configured**: Database backups running automatically

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks

1. **Data Loss**: Mitigate with database backups and transaction rollback
2. **Performance Issues**: Mitigate with query optimization and caching
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Mitigate with security testing and code review
4. **Integration Failures**: Mitigate with comprehensive integration tests
5. **User Experience Issues**: Mitigate with manual testing and user feedback

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues are found:
1. Document the issue with reproduction steps
2. Assess severity and impact
3. Fix issue in development environment
4. Re-test affected functionality
5. Validate fix doesn't break other features
6. Deploy fix to production

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing and validation strategy ensures the food delivery platform is thoroughly tested with real data before production deployment. By systematically testing every feature, API endpoint, and frontend component, we can identify and fix issues early, ensuring a smooth launch and positive user experience.
