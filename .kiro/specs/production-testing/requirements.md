# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for comprehensive testing and validation of the food delivery platform to ensure production readiness. The platform has a complete backend implementation using Next.js API routes and Supabase, along with a fully functional frontend. The goal is to systematically test every function, API endpoint, and frontend component with real data (no mocks) to identify and fix any issues before production deployment.

The testing effort covers all user roles (customers, restaurant owners, delivery drivers, and super administrators), all features (authentication, ordering, delivery tracking, loyalty programs, admin dashboards), and all integration points between frontend and backend.
