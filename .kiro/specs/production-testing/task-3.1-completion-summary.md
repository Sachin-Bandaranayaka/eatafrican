## Issues Found

None. All functionality worked as expected.

## Recommendations

1. **Image Upload Testing:** Perform manual testing with actual image files to verify:
   - File type validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
   - File size validation (max 5MB)
   - Supabase Storage integration
   - Public URL generation
   - Image accessibility

2. **Email Notifications:** The code has a TODO comment for email notifications. Consider implementing email service integration to send approval emails to restaurant owners.

3. **Duplicate Restaurant Check:** The API correctly prevents restaurant owners from creating multiple restaurants (409 Conflict response).

## Conclusion

Task 3.1 (Restaurant Creation and Approval) has been successfully completed. All core functionality works correctly with real data:

- ✅ Restaurant owner registration
- ✅ Restaurant creation with complete data
- ✅ Pending status assignment
- ✅ Owner ID verification
- ✅ Admin approval workflow
- ✅ Status change to active
- ✅ Notification creation
- ✅ Activity logging

The system is ready for the next testing phase (Task 3.2: Restaurant Listing and Filtering).
