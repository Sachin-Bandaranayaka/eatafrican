# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for building a complete backend system for an existing food delivery platform. The platform currently has a fully functional frontend with multiple user interfaces (customers, restaurant owners, delivery drivers, and super administrators) but all data is currently hardcoded. The backend must be designed to support all existing frontend functionality without requiring any changes to the frontend code.

The system operates in Switzerland and supports multiple cities (Basel, Bern, Luzern, ZÃ¼rich, Olten) with multi-language support (EN, DE, FR, IT). The platform facilitates food ordering from African restaurants with features including user authentication, restaurant management, order processing, delivery tracking, loyalty programs, and comprehensive admin dashboards.
