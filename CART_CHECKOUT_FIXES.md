# Cart Checkout Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Invisible Text in Form Inputs
**Problem**: Text color in postal code, town, street, and other input fields was not visible (appearing grey or invisible).

**Solution**: Added `text-black` class to all input fields in both `cart-connected.tsx` and `delivery-info-view.tsx`.

**Files Modified**:
- `components/cart-connected.tsx` - Added text color to postal code, town, street, delivery time, and voucher code inputs
- `components/delivery-info-view.tsx` - Added text color to all form inputs (firstname, lastname, email, phone, postal code, town, street, delivery time, voucher code, card details)

### 2. ✅ Dynamic Delivery Fee Calculation
**Problem**: Delivery fee was always showing as Fr. 6.00 regardless of location.

**Solution**: Implemented postal code-based delivery fee calculation with Swiss postal code ranges:

- **Basel area (4000-4999)**: Fr. 6.00
- **Zurich area (8000-8999)**: Fr. 8.00
- **Bern area (3000-3999)**: Fr. 7.00
- **Geneva area (1200-1299)**: Fr. 9.00
- **Other areas**: Fr. 10.00

The delivery fee now updates automatically when the user enters their postal code and city.

**File Modified**: `components/cart-connected.tsx`

### 3. ✅ Order Confirmation Flow
**Problem**: No clear way to complete the order after filling in delivery details.

**Solution**: 
- The "PLACE YOUR ORDER" button in the `DeliveryInfoView` component is now properly connected to the order placement logic
- Added loading state to the button showing "PLACING ORDER..." while processing
- Button is disabled during order processing to prevent duplicate submissions
- After successful order placement, the cart is cleared and user sees the payment success view
- If order fails, user sees the payment error view with option to retry

**How it works**:
1. User fills in delivery address (postal code, town, street)
2. User selects delivery time
3. User optionally enters voucher code
4. User clicks "PLACE YOUR ORDER" button
5. System validates all required fields
6. Order is submitted to `/api/orders` endpoint
7. On success: Cart is cleared, success view is shown
8. On error: Error view is shown with retry option

**Files Modified**:
- `components/delivery-info-view.tsx` - Added loading prop and disabled state to button
- `components/cart-connected.tsx` - Connected loading state to DeliveryInfoView

## Notes

- The delivery fee calculation is based on Swiss postal code ranges and can be customized further if needed
- Payment gateway integration is not yet implemented, so the payment method fields are placeholders
- Guest checkout is supported - users don't need to log in to place orders
- The order is submitted to `/api/orders` endpoint with all necessary details
