**NPM Scripts Added:**
```json
{
  "seed": "ts-node scripts/seed-database.ts",
  "export-data": "ts-node scripts/export-data.ts",
  "import-data": "ts-node scripts/import-data.ts"
}
```

**Dependencies Added:**
- `ts-node`: ^10.9.2 (for running TypeScript scripts)
- `dotenv`: ^16.4.5 (for environment variable management)

## Technical Implementation

### Seed Data Structure
```
Users → Restaurants → Menu Items
  ↓         ↓
Drivers   Orders → Order Items
  ↓         ↓
Loyalty Points  Loyalty Transactions
  ↓
Vouchers, Favorites, Notifications, Activity Logs
```

### Export/Import Flow
```
Database → Export Script → JSON Files (Backup)
JSON Files (Backup) → Import Script → Database
```

### Batch Processing
- Import script processes 100 records at a time
- Prevents timeout errors on large datasets
- Progress tracking for long operations

## Usage Examples

### Seeding Database
```bash
# Method 1: Via Supabase Dashboard
# Copy contents of supabase/seed.sql to SQL Editor

# Method 2: Via psql
psql "postgresql://postgres:[PASSWORD]@[HOST]:5432/postgres" -f supabase/seed.sql

# Method 3: Via Supabase CLI
supabase db reset
```

### Exporting Data
```bash
npm run export-data
# Creates: backups/backup-2025-01-07/
```

### Importing Data
```bash
npm run import-data backups/backup-2025-01-07
```

## Testing Scenarios Covered

The seed data supports testing of:

1. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - All user roles (customer, restaurant_owner, driver, super_admin)
   - Multiple language preferences
   - Active and pending accounts

2. **Restaurant Management**
   - Active and pending restaurants
   - Multiple cities and regions
   - Various cuisine types

   - Multiple order statuses

5. **Driver Operations**
   - Order assignment
   - Delivery tracking
   - Earnings calculation
   - Multiple pickup zones

6. **Loyalty Program**
   - Points earning
   - Points redemption
   - Referral bonuses
   - Transaction history

7. **Notifications**

## Files Modified/Created

### Created:
- `scripts/seed-database.ts` - Seeding utility
- `scripts/export-data.ts` - Data export utility
- `scripts/import-data.ts` - Data import utility
- `scripts/README.md` - Scripts documentation
- `TASK_16_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified:
- `supabase/seed.sql` - Enhanced with comprehensive data
- `package.json` - Added scripts and dependencies

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ Create sample users for each role
✅ Create sample restaurants with menu items
✅ Create sample orders in various states
✅ Create sample loyalty points and vouchers
✅ Script to export data for backup
✅ Script to import/migrate data
✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Initial Seed:**
   - Use Supabase Dashboard or psql to run `supabase/seed.sql`

3. **Test Export/Import:**
   ```bash
   npm run export-data
   npm run import-data backups/backup-[date]
   ```

4. **Integrate with CI/CD:**
   - Add seeding to deployment pipeline
   - Automate backups before deployments

## Notes

- All test users use password: `password123` (hashed with bcrypt)
- Seed data is idempotent (can be run multiple times safely)
- Export creates timestamped backups to avoid overwrites
- Import uses upsert to handle existing records
- Scripts require SUPABASE_URL and SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in .env

## Verification

To verify the implementation:

1. Check seed file exists and is comprehensive:
   ```bash
   cat supabase/seed.sql | grep "INSERT INTO" | wc -l
   ```

2. Verify scripts are executable:
   ```bash
   ls -la scripts/*.ts
   ```

3. Test export functionality:
   ```bash
   npm run export-data
   ls -la backups/
   ```

4. Review documentation:
   ```bash
   cat scripts/README.md
   ```

## Conclusion

Task 16 has been successfully completed with comprehensive database seeding and migration utilities. The implementation provides:
- Rich, realistic test data covering all system features
- Robust export/import utilities for data management
- Clear documentation and usage instructions
- Support for multiple seeding methods
- Batch processing for large datasets
- Proper error handling and progress tracking

The system is now ready for development, testing, and production deployment with proper data management capabilities.
