# Task 8: Customer Features APIs - Completion Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented all customer features APIs including favorites management, loyalty points system, and customer profile management.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 8.1 Customer Favorites Listing
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/customers/[id]/favorites`
- Fetches all favorited menu items with restaurant details
- Returns formatted data matching frontend expectations
- Includes menu item details (name, description, price, image, dietary tags)
- Includes restaurant information (name, address, city, region)
- Implements proper authentication and authorization

### 8.2 Add Favorite
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/customers/[id]/favorites`
- Adds menu item to customer's favorites
- Validates menu item exists before adding
- Prevents duplicate favorites (returns 409 Conflict)
- Returns created favorite with 201 status

### 8.3 Remove Favorite
**Endpoint:** `DELETE /api/customers/[id]/favorites/[itemId]`
- Removes menu item from customer's favorites
- Validates favorite exists before deletion
- Returns 404 if favorite not found
- Returns success message on deletion

### 8.4 Loyalty Points
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/customers/[id]/loyalty`
- Fetches customer's loyalty points balance and lifetime points
- Returns referral code (auto-generated if not exists)
- Lists available rewards (10%, 20%, 50% discounts) with availability status
- Fetches loyalty transaction history (last 50 transactions)
- Auto-creates loyalty record if it doesn't exist

### 8.5 Loyalty Points Redemption
**Endpoint:** `POST /api/customers/[id]/loyalty/redeem`
- Validates customer has sufficient points
- Deducts points from balance
- Generates unique voucher code with discount
- Creates voucher with 30-day expiration
- Creates loyalty transaction record
- Uses transaction wrapper for data consistency
- Returns voucher details and new balance

### 8.6 Customer Profile
**Endpoint:** `GET /api/customers/[id]`
- Fetches customer profile information
- Returns order history summary (total orders, completed orders, total spent)
- Includes recent orders (last 5)
- Includes loyalty points balance and lifetime points
- Comprehensive customer data for dashboard display

### 8.7 Customer Profile Update
**Endpoint:** `PATCH /api/customers/[id]`
- Updates customer information (firstName, lastName, phone, language)
- Validates customer or admin role
- Supports partial updates
- Returns updated customer profile

## Key Features Implemented

### Authentication & Authorization
- All endpoints use `requireCustomerAccess` middleware
- Validates JWT token and user permissions
- Super admins can access any customer data
- Customers can only access their own data

### Data Validation
- Uses Zod schemas for request validation
- Validates UUIDs, email formats, and required fields
- Returns detailed validation errors

### Error Handling
- Consistent error response format
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 409, 422, 500)
- Detailed error messages for debugging
- Handles authentication, validation, and database errors

### Loyalty System Logic
- Three reward tiers: 100 points (10%), 200 points (20%), 500 points (50%)
- Auto-generates unique referral codes
- Vouchers expire after 30 days
- Transaction history tracking
- Prevents redemption with insufficient points

### Database Operations
- Efficient queries with proper joins
- Transaction support for redemption operations
- Proper error handling and logging
- Pagination support where applicable

## Files Created
1. `app/api/customers/[id]/favorites/route.ts` - GET and POST for favorites
2. `app/api/customers/[id]/favorites/[itemId]/route.ts` - DELETE for favorites
3. `app/api/customers/[id]/loyalty/route.ts` - GET loyalty points
4. `app/api/customers/[id]/loyalty/redeem/route.ts` - POST redeem points
5. `app/api/customers/[id]/route.ts` - GET and PATCH customer profile

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ Requirement 7.1-7.7: Search, filtering, and sorting (favorites)
- ✅ Requirement 6.1-6.7: Loyalty and rewards program
- ✅ Requirement 1.1-1.7: User authentication and authorization
- ✅ Requirement 11.1-11.7: Multi-language support (language preference updates)

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test favorites CRUD operations with valid and invalid menu items
2. Test duplicate favorite prevention
3. Test loyalty points redemption with sufficient and insufficient points
4. Test voucher generation and expiration
5. Test customer profile updates with various field combinations
6. Test authentication and authorization for all endpoints
7. Test error handling for edge cases

## Next Steps
The customer features APIs are complete and ready for integration with the frontend. The next task in the implementation plan is Task 9: Implement super admin APIs.

## TypeScript Validation
All implemented files passed TypeScript diagnostics with no errors.
