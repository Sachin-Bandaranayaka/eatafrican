# Task 14 Completion Summary: Search and Filtering Utilities

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive search and filtering utilities for the food delivery backend system. These utilities provide reusable functions for filtering, sorting, and querying restaurants, menu items, and orders.

## Completed Subtasks

### ✅ 14.1 Create distance calculation utility
**Status**: Already implemented in previous tasks

The distance calculation utility was already implemented in `lib/utils/distance.ts` with the following features:
- Haversine formula for accurate distance calculation between coordinates
- Distance formatting (e.g., "9 km, 47 min from Olten")
- Travel time estimation based on average city speed
- Delivery fee calculation based on distance
- Bounding box calculation for radius queries
- Delivery radius validation

### ✅ 14.2 Create sorting and filtering utilities
**Status**: Completed

Created `lib/utils/filtering.ts` with comprehensive filtering and sorting utilities:

#### Filter Functions
1. **Restaurant Filters**
   - Filter by city, region, cuisine type
   - Filter by price range (min/max)
   - Full-text search on name and description
   - Filter by status (pending, active, suspended)

2. **Menu Item Filters**
   - Filter by category (meals, drinks, special_deals)
   - Filter by dietary tags (vegan, vegetarian, etc.)
   - Full-text search on name and description
   - Filter by status and restaurant

3. **Order Filters**
   - Filter by customer, restaurant, driver
   - Filter by order status
   - Filter by date range (start/end dates)
   - Filter by delivery region/city

#### Sorting Functions
1. **Database Sorting**
   - Generic `applySorting` function for Supabase queries
   - Support for single or multiple sort fields
   - Ascending/descending order support

2. **In-Memory Sorting**
   - `sortByDistance` for distance-based sorting
   - `sortItems` for generic field-based sorting
   - Proper handling of null/undefined values

3. **Predefined Sort Options**
   - `getRestaurantSortOptions`: rating, name, price, distance
   - `getMenuItemSortOptions`: price, name, category+name
   - `getOrderSortOptions`: date, total, status

#### Query Builder Functions
1. **Complete Query Builders**
   - `buildRestaurantQuery`: Combines filters and sorting
   - `buildMenuItemQuery`: Combines filters and sorting
   - `buildOrderQuery`: Combines filters and sorting

2. **Parameter Parsers**
   - `parseRestaurantFilters`: Parse URL search params
   - `parseMenuItemFilters`: Parse URL search params
   - `parseOrderFilters`: Parse URL search params

#### Utility Functions
- `filterItems`: Generic in-memory filtering with predicates
- Type-safe filter options interfaces
- Proper TypeScript typing throughout

## Files Created/Modified

### Created Files
1. **lib/utils/filtering.ts** (463 lines)
   - Core filtering and sorting utilities
   - Type definitions for filter options
   - Query builder functions
   - Parameter parsing utilities

2. **lib/utils/filtering.examples.md** (280 lines)
   - Comprehensive usage documentation
   - Code examples for all utilities
   - Query parameter examples
   - Advanced usage patterns

### Modified Files
1. **lib/utils/index.ts**
   - Added export for filtering utilities

## Requirements Verification

All requirements from Requirement 7 (Search, Filtering, and Sorting) are satisfied:

✅ **7.1**: Search by cuisine type - `applyRestaurantFilters` with `cuisineType` filter
✅ **7.2**: Filter by dietary preference - `applyMenuItemFilters` with `dietaryTag` filter
✅ **7.3**: Sort by distance - `sortByDistance` function with distance calculation
✅ **7.4**: Sort by rating - `getRestaurantSortOptions('rating')` returns descending sort
✅ **7.5**: Filter by price range - `minPrice` and `maxPrice` filters
✅ **7.6**: Search by restaurant name - Full-text search with `ilike` for partial matching
✅ **7.7**: Empty result handling - Natural handling by query builder

## Integration Points

The filtering utilities integrate seamlessly with existing API routes:

1. **Restaurant API** (`app/api/restaurants/route.ts`)
   - Already uses distance calculation
   - Can be refactored to use new filtering utilities

2. **Menu API** (`app/api/restaurants/[id]/menu/route.ts`)
   - Already implements filtering logic
   - Can be refactored to use new filtering utilities

3. **Order APIs**
   - Can use order filtering utilities for customer/driver/admin views

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { db } from '@/lib/supabase/database';
import {
  parseRestaurantFilters,
  buildRestaurantQuery,
  sortByDistance,
} from '@/lib/utils/filtering';

export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const { searchParams } = new URL(req.url);
  
  // Parse filters from query parameters
  const filters = parseRestaurantFilters(searchParams);
  const sortBy = searchParams.get('sortBy') || 'name';
  
  // Build and execute query
  const baseQuery = db.from('restaurants').select('*');
  const query = buildRestaurantQuery(baseQuery, filters, sortBy);
  const { data: restaurants } = await query;
  
  // Handle distance sorting if needed
  if (sortBy === 'distance') {
    const sorted = sortByDistance(restaurants, 'asc');
    return NextResponse.json({ restaurants: sorted });
  }
  
  return NextResponse.json({ restaurants });
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Reusability**: Utilities can be used across all API routes
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper interfaces
3. **Consistency**: Standardized filtering and sorting across the platform
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized logic for easier updates
5. **Flexibility**: Support for both database and in-memory operations
6. **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples for developers

## Testing Considerations

While no test framework is currently configured, the utilities are designed to be testable:
- Pure functions with no side effects
- Clear input/output contracts
- Proper error handling
- Type safety prevents many runtime errors

## Next Steps

1. **Optional Refactoring**: Existing API routes can be refactored to use these utilities
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor query performance with complex filters
3. **Caching**: Consider caching frequently used filter combinations
4. **Testing**: Add unit tests when test framework is configured

## Conclusion

Task 14 is complete with all subtasks implemented. The filtering and sorting utilities provide a robust, type-safe foundation for search and filtering functionality across the food delivery platform. The implementation satisfies all requirements and provides excellent developer experience with comprehensive documentation.
